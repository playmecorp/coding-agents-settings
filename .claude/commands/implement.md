# Implement the following plan
Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan` then `Report` the completed work.

## Instructions
- Read the plan, think hard about the plan and implement the plan.
- IMPORTANT: This command expects the plan to be a file path to a spec file (e.g., `specs/feature-name.md`).
- As you complete each phase and task in the Implementation Plan and Step by Step Tasks sections:
  1. Update the spec file by checking off the completed checkbox (- [ ] → - [x])
  2. Fill in the Status field with completion status (e.g., "Completed", "In Progress", "Partially Done")
  3. Fill in the Comments field with brief notes about what was done, any issues encountered, or important decisions made
- Update the spec file progressively after completing each phase/task, not just at the end.
- Use the Edit tool to update checkboxes and fields in the spec file as you progress.
